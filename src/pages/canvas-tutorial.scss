  /*
  If your renderings seem distorted,
  try specifying your width and height attributes explicitly in the <canvas> attributes,
  and not using CSS.

  The <canvas> element can be styled just like any normal image (margin, border, backgroundâ€¦).
  These rules, however, don't affect the actual drawing on the canvas.

  When no styling rules are applied to the canvas it will initially be fully transparent.
